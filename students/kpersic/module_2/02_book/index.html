    <h1>1. Markup languages</h1>
    <p>A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Markup languages
        are used to annotate a document in a way
        that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.</p>

    <p><strong>Types of markup languages</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong> Presentational markup</strong>- used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary
            codes embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word).</li>
        <li><strong>Procedural markup</strong>- markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for
            programs to process the text (e.g. TeX).</li>
        <li><strong>Descriptive (logical) markup</strong>- markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to
            provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. HTML).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.2. HTML</h2>
    <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
        browser. <br>
        HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content
        to make it appear or act a certain way.</p>

    <p><strong> How the browser displays HTML </strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree.</li>
        <li>The DOM tree is used to construct a render tree.</li>
        <li>A layout is generated from the render tree.</li>
        <li>The render three is painted to the screen according to the generated layout.</li>
    </ol>
